# Hong-Santiago-Kong

Dear Cofounder,
How was your day? Where are you from? What do you like to do for fun? What are your hopes and dreams?

I’m in Santiago, Chile by the way. Working here, at a startup, is one way I’m preparing to learn how to grow a startup for when we start ours.

Santiago is an interesting city. I promised myself before I came that I wouldn’t have any expectations. I would just experience the city moment to moment, human to human. No planning, no expectations.

Well I broke my promise. I realized the past few days that I had unconsciously expected the city to be more… more alive.

To give you context, last winter I studied abroad in Hong Kong. Afterwards, I backpacked through Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. I experienced the cities of Taipei, Bangkok, and Saigon. These cities, Hong Kong included, were all 25/8 cities.

On the perimeter of a huge roundabout in Saigon, so huge it could fit 27 motorbikes side-to-side, there were 5 coffee shops, 3 of which were in fact open 24 hours a day. I can taste the just-sweet-enough, $1.25 iced coffee now.

In Taipei, gourmet restaurants of every taste and cozy warm hostels were laid out, side-to-side and face-to-face. You could eat at the former and snuggle in the latter, no more than $8 each.

In Bangkok, you could step outside into a lively, buzzing street, with too many pad thai, fried rice, and fresh fruit stalls to choose from.

And Hong Kong? Oh, please, don’t even get me started. This is the city of cities. The mecca of metropolises. If anything, it was too city for me. And that’s saying something. Nowhere else in the world will you be so overpowered from just the sheer energy of a city.

In Santiago… well, I don’t want to be too critical. I don’t want to be that guy. I’ve only been here for a week and a half, after all. And it is winter, after all. But based on my first impressions, it seems rather... dormant.

On the weekdays, shops seem to close at 9. On the weekends, shops seem to be… not open?

Where is the ferocity? Where is the untamed madness that I look for in a city? The chaos is sometimes felt, especially in the metro during peak hours. But when the sun goes down in Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, Saigon, it’s almost as if the cities double in size. The beast gets let out of its cage. And the streets, the buildings, the bars, and the people… teeeern up. (sorry)

I didn’t mean to have expectations for Santiago. I intentionally set out not to. But, unconsciously, the way I saw and see it … was and continues to be ... colored by the previous cities I’ve experienced.

And this is perhaps not a bad thing. With our future business(es), the opportunities we see and decisions we make will be informed by our past experiences. The lessons I am learning through implementing some of Brian Balfour’s "Fundamentals of Growth" at the startup I’m working at are preparing me for when our business will scale. The next generation products I learned to communicate at Tesla will inspire the products you and I will design for the customers we will one day be given the opportunity to serve.

There’s something else you should know about my Hong Kong experience. I fell in love. Like Tesla did, like GroupRaise is doing now, she set a high standard of excellence. It’s hard to imagine who, at that point in time, could’ve been more perfect for me. Likewise, it’s hard to imagine these two companies, Tesla then and GroupRaise now, being more perfect than they have been, at least for me.

And so finally, just like the cities we have experienced and the people we have loved, we will let it all inspire us. Whether we set up shop in Santiago because the wifi+wine are both cheap (Santiago has its perks!) or in my parent's garage (for even cheaper wifi+wine), we will let all of it inspire us. We will let all of it, both the Hong Kongs and the Santiagos of the world, inspire us. And we will inspire back.

Too mushy?

Take care,
Your cofounder
